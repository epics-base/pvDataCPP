     * @brief A vector of bits.
     *
     * This class implements a vector of bits that grows as needed. Each
     * component of the bit set has a @c bool value. The bits of a
     * @c BitSet are indexed by nonnegative integers. Individual
     * indexed bits can be examined, set, or cleared. One @c BitSet may
     * be used to modify the contents of another @c BitSet through
     * logical AND, logical inclusive OR, and logical exclusive OR
     * operations.
     *
     * <p>By default, all bits in the set initially have the value
     * @c false.
     *
     * <p>Every bit set has a current size, which is the number of bits
     * of space currently in use by the bit set. Note that the size is
     * related to the implementation of a bit set, so it may change with
     * implementation. The length of a bit set relates to logical length
     * of a bit set and is defined independently of implementation.
     *
     * <p>A @c BitSet is not safe for multithreaded use without external
     * synchronization.
     *
     * Based on Java implementation.
